The programs spherocyl_strain and spherocyl_resize can both take user input through the command line arguments or using an input file and input redirection ( < ), ie:

./spherocyl_strain < input_file.txt

where input_file.txt is a list of arguments, each on it's own line

The order of the arguments for spherocyl_strain are:

1) A position data file to load (or "r" to start from a new random configuration (text)
2) The output directory to save data (text)
3) The number of spherocylinders (integer)
4) The strain rate (float)
5) The integration step size (float)
6) The length of the run in terms of the strain parameter gamma (float)
7) How often to save position data files (in terms of gamma) (float)
8) How often to save the stress tensor components and energy (float)
9) A padding number which determines how often new neighbor lists need to be generated (too small or too big and the program may run slow, I usually use around 0.1)
10) The packing fraction (only necessary when using a random configuration)
11) The spherocylinder half-shaft length (only necessary when using a random configuration)
12) The spherocylinder radius (only necessary when using a random configuration)


The arguments for spherocyl_resize are the same except:

4) A resize rate instead of strain rate
6) The final packing fraction
10) This is the initial packing fraction when using a random file
